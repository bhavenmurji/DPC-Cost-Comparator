# DPC Frontier Partnership Request

**To**: info@dpcfrontier.com (or contact form at dpcfrontier.com)
**Subject**: API Access Request - Healthcare Cost Comparison Platform Partnership

---

Dear DPC Frontier Team,

I'm reaching out regarding a potential partnership opportunity for **Ignite Health Partnerships**, a comprehensive healthcare cost comparison platform I'm developing.

## About Ignite Health Partnerships

We're building a consumer-facing platform (similar to CompareTheMeerkat.com in the UK) that helps Americans make informed healthcare decisions by comparing:

- **Traditional marketplace insurance** (via Healthcare.gov API integration)
- **DPC + Catastrophic insurance + out-of-pocket solutions**

Our goal is to drive patient awareness and adoption of Direct Primary Care by providing transparent, side-by-side cost comparisons.

## Why DPC Frontier?

Your mapper (mapper.dpcfrontier.com) is the most comprehensive DPC provider directory available, with 2,060+ practices across 48 states. We believe integrating your data would:

1. **Increase DPC visibility** - Help more patients discover local DPC practices
2. **Drive patient conversions** - Users seeing cost savings will seek DPC providers
3. **Benefit your community** - More traffic and inquiries to listed practices

## What We're Requesting

We'd like to explore:

1. **API access** to your provider database (if available)
2. **Data partnership** - Licensed access to provider listings
3. **Embedding your mapper** - Integration via iframe/widget
4. **Data refresh schedule** - How to keep provider info current

## What We Offer

- **Attribution & backlinks** to DPC Frontier on every page
- **Traffic referrals** - Link directly to your site for provider details
- **Provider verification** - Help identify outdated listings
- **Shared analytics** - Insights on which areas have highest DPC demand

## Our Integration Plans

**Healthcare.gov**: Already integrated (API key obtained)
**GoodRx**: Applying for API access
**DPC Providers**: DPC Frontier (you!) as primary source

## Technical Details

- Platform: Node.js/TypeScript backend, Next.js frontend
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Hosting: HIPAA-compliant infrastructure
- Launch: Q1 2026 (beta), Q2 2026 (public)

## Next Steps

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to discuss partnership possibilities? I'm available at your convenience.

Alternatively, if you have:
- An API documentation page
- Data licensing information
- Partnership guidelines

I'd be happy to review and proceed accordingly.

Thank you for building such a valuable resource for the DPC community. We're excited about the possibility of working together to expand DPC awareness and adoption.

Best regards,

**[Your Title]** - Founder, Ignite Health Partnerships
**Email**: [your email]
**Phone**: [your phone]
**Website**: [project URL if available]

## Backup Plan (If No Response)

If we don't hear back or partnership isn't possible, we plan to:
1. Web scrape publicly available data from your mapper (with proper attribution)
2. Build a provider submission form for DPC practices to self-list
3. Manually verify provider information
4. Continue attributing DPC Frontier as a data source

We believe in the DPC movement and want to support it responsibly and ethically.
